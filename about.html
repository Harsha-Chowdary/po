        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). My journey began with a five-month internship at Maganti IT Solutions, where I transitioned into a remote employee in May 2023. Over the course of one year and one month, I dedicated myself to developing a chatbot for the company website and providing support on AI-related projects. This experience ignited my love for AI, ML, and robotics.

            My growing interest in these fields inspired me to develop two projects in college: a Human Activity Detection system and a Driver Drowsiness Detection system. Currently, I am working on a multiplatform quiz app tailored for an educational institution.

            After completing my second year, I undertook a summer internship at AIMERS, where I learned about creating Telegram bots and building custom datasets using YOLO. I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity, constantly pushing myself to learn and apply new technologies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy diving into tech articles, enhancing my problem-solving skills, and staying updated with the latest trends in AI and software development.
